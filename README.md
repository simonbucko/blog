## About

This project is used to create a simple blog application. The project is using GrpahCMS as a solution for storing and managing posts as well as comments. The purpose of this blog was just to demonstrate my skills, so actual posts and content do not have any value.

## Used stack

- NextJS
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- vercel
- GrpahCMS

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
